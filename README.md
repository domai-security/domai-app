# DōmAI Security Alliance - Complete Project Documentation

## Project Overview
- Name: DōmAI (Dōmei + Dome + AI)
- Website: domai.dev
- Support: humans@domai.dev
- Technical: ai@domai.dev
- Purpose: Unifying and simplifying Mac security & maintenance

## Core Innovations: Real-Time Dual-Stream Security Analysis

### The Dual-Stream Interface
DōmAI introduces a revolutionary approach to security analysis through two parallel text streams displayed side by side:

1. Crisis Stream (Primary Interaction)
   - Natural language input ("I think I've been hacked")
   - Brief, focused clarifying questions:
     ```
     Is this concern due to:
     a) Slow performance
     b) Unexpected network activity
     c) Strange files or programs
     d) Other (describe)
     ```
   - User can either:
     - Choose an option
     - Skip questions entirely
     - Respond in natural language
   - Shows real-time security checks and results
   - Maintains focus on immediate security concerns

2. Knowledge Stream (Parallel Context)
   - Updates in real-time alongside crisis stream
   - Explains why specific tests are being run:
     ```
     Running tcpdump first because unexpected network
     activity often indicates compromise. Looking for
     connections to known malicious IPs...
     ```
   - Provides educational context without interrupting
   - Makes security decisions transparent
   - Builds understanding during actual security events

### How It Works
1. User Input Phase
   - User describes concern in natural language
   - LLM asks minimal, skippable clarifying questions
   - System begins prioritizing security checks
   
2. Analysis Phase
   Crisis Stream:
   ```
   Running network scan...
   Found 3 suspicious connections
   Checking process list...
   ```

   Knowledge Stream:
   ```
   Network scan uses tcpdump to monitor active
   connections. Suspicious connections are those
   to unknown IPs or on unusual ports...
   ```

3. Real-Time Response
   Crisis Stream focuses on:
   - Immediate findings
   - Action items
   - Critical alerts
   - Next steps

   Knowledge Stream explains:
   - Why tests were chosen
   - What results mean
   - Security concepts
   - Technical context

This dual-stream approach solves a critical problem in security tools: maintaining urgent security response while building user knowledge, without either goal compromising the other.

## Current Mac Security Landscape

### Existing Tools & Fragmentation
1. System Information & Diagnostics
   - EtreCheck: System report generation
   - OnyX: System maintenance & configuration
   - Pareto Security: Basic security checks
   - KnockKnock: Launch item checker
   - BlockBlock: Installation monitor
   - XProCheck: Malware definitions
   - LockRattler: Security system checks
   - Silent Knight: Security update checks
   - DHS: Dylib vulnerabilities/hijack search
   - Signet: Signature verification
   - Taccy: Privacy permission checks
   - Murus: Packet firewall management
   - Apparency: File integrity
   - Lynis: System security audit
   - Zap (OWASP ZAP): vulnerabilities in webapps
   - Wireshark/TCPdump: Packet Sniffing
   - Rkhunter: Rootkit detector
   - Little Snitch: Network connections
   - Virustotal: Check IPs

2. Problems with Current Approach
   - Tools don't communicate with each other
   - Inconsistent interfaces
   - Overlapping functionality
   - Varying levels of maintenance
   - Different learning curves
   - No unified data view
   - CLI power hidden behind complexity
   - Time wasted on learning curve
   - Copying and Pasting between tools

### What CLI Can Actually Do
- Network monitoring (tcpdump, lsof, netstat)
- Process monitoring (ps, top, htop)
- System configuration (defaults, nvram)
- Security settings (spctl, csrutil)
- File system monitoring (fs_usage, opensnoop)
- Hardware diagnostics (system_profiler)
- Application management (codesign, xattr)

## DōmAI Solution

### Core Philosophy
- "One dome to protect it all. One AI to find them. One alliance to bring them and in quarantine, bind them."
- Unified interface for all security/maintenance tasks
- Progressive learning through use
- Power of CLI with accessibility of GUI
- Adaptive to user skill level

## Real Talk Section - Extended

### Why Everything's So Fragmented
1. Historical reasons:
   - Tools developed independently
   - Different developers solving specific problems
   - No standardization
   - Apple's changing security model

2. Technical reasons:
   - Different subsystems
   - Varying permission requirements
   - Complex integration needs
   - System update challenges

3. Market reasons:
   - Niche solutions
   - Different target users
   - Varying business models
   - Support limitations

### How We're Fixing This
1. Technical Integration:
   - Unified command framework
   - Consistent permission model
   - Centralized monitoring
   - Standardized data presentation

2. User Experience:
   - Single learning curve
   - Progressive feature revelation
   - Consistent interface
   - Contextual help

3. Security Approach:
   - Comprehensive protection
   - Intelligent monitoring
   - Proactive maintenance
   - Educational components

## Additional Technical Considerations

### CLI Integration
- Wrapper for complex commands
- Visual command builder
- Result interpretation
- Command learning system

### Permission Management
- Unified permission requests
- Clear purpose explanation
- Permission tracking
- Security impact awareness

### System Integration
- Kernel extension management
- System extension handling
- Network filter integration
- File system monitoring

## Final Thoughts
The Mac security/maintenance landscape is a mess of fragmented tools. Each one is powerful in its niche, but users shouldn't need 12 different apps to keep their system secure and maintained. DōmAI isn't just another tool - it's the unification and simplification of Mac system management.

Remember: The power of the command line with the accessibility of a modern interface, growing with the user's needs and abilities.

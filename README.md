# DōmAI Security Alliance - Complete Project Documentation

## Project Overview
- Name: DōmAI (Dōmei + Dome + AI)
- Website: domai.dev
- Support: humans@domai.dev
- Technical: ai@domai.dev
- Purpose: Unifying and simplifying Mac security & maintenance

## Current Mac Security Landscape

### Existing Tools & Fragmentation
1. System Information & Diagnostics
   - EtreCheck: System report generation
   - OnyX: System maintenance & configuration
   - Pareto Security: Basic security checks
   - KnockKnock: Launch item checker
   - BlockBlock: Installation monitor
   - XProtectCheck: Malware definitions
   - LockRattler: Security system checks
   - Silent Knight: Security update checks
   - DHS: Hardware diagnostics
   - Signet: Signature verification
   - Taccy: Privacy permission checks
   - Murus: Firewall management

2. Problems with Current Approach
   - Tools don't communicate with each other
   - Inconsistent interfaces
   - Overlapping functionality
   - Varying levels of maintenance
   - Different learning curves
   - No unified data view
   - CLI power hidden behind complexity

### What CLI Can Actually Do
- Network monitoring (tcpdump, lsof, netstat)
- Process monitoring (ps, top, htop)
- System configuration (defaults, nvram)
- Security settings (spctl, csrutil)
- File system monitoring (fs_usage, opensnoop)
- Hardware diagnostics (system_profiler)
- Application management (codesign, xattr)

## DōmAI Solution

### Core Philosophy
- "One dome to protect them all"
- Unified interface for all security/maintenance tasks
- Progressive learning through use
- Power of CLI with accessibility of GUI
- Adaptive to user skill level

## Recent Innovations

### Dual-Stream Security Analysis
Building on our core philosophy, we've developed a novel approach to security monitoring and education:

1. Crisis Stream
   - Real-time security analysis focused on immediate threats
   - Direct, action-oriented responses
   - Prioritizes critical information during active issues
   - No interruption for educational content during crises

2. Knowledge Stream
   - Parallel educational context without interrupting crisis handling
   - Real-time explanation of security concepts
   - Progressive technical depth based on user expertise
   - Learning opportunities identified from actual security events

3. Unified Context
   - Single LLM conversation managing both streams
   - Shared security context between streams
   - Intelligent priority management
   - Seamless knowledge integration

### Enhanced User Interaction
1. Natural Language Security Plan
   - Converts user concerns to action plans
   - 5-second review window with pause capability
   - Technical commands available via hover tooltips
   - Progressive complexity based on user level

2. Real-Time Learning Integration
   - Learning opportunities identified during actual security events
   - Post-incident knowledge checks
   - Skill progression through real usage
   - Context-aware technical depth

## Final Thoughts
The Mac security/maintenance landscape is a mess of fragmented tools. Each one is powerful in its niche, but users shouldn't need 12 different apps to keep their system secure and maintained. DōmAI isn't just another tool - it's the unification and simplification of Mac system management.

Remember: The power of the command line with the accessibility of a modern interface, growing with the user's needs and abilities.

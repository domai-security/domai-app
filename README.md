# DōmAI Security Alliance - Complete Project Documentation

## Project Overview
- Name: DōmAI (Dōmei + Dome + AI)
- Website: domai.dev
- Support: humans@domai.dev
- Technical: ai@domai.dev
- Purpose: Unifying and simplifying Mac security & maintenance

## Core Innovation: Dual-Stream Security Analysis

DōmAI introduces a groundbreaking approach to security monitoring and education:

### Crisis Stream
- Real-time security analysis focused on immediate threats
- Direct, action-oriented responses
- Prioritizes critical information during active issues
- No interruption for educational content during crises

### Knowledge Stream
- Parallel educational context without interrupting crisis handling
- Real-time explanation of security concepts
- Progressive technical depth based on user expertise
- Learning opportunities identified from actual security events

This dual-stream approach allows users to:
1. Handle security issues efficiently without distraction
2. Learn from real situations without compromising response time
3. Progress naturally in security expertise through actual usage

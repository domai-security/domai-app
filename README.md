## Project Overview
- **Name:** DōmAI (Dōmei + Dome + AI)
- **Website:** domai.dev
- **Support:** humans@domai.dev
- **Technical Contact:** ai@domai.dev
- **Purpose:** Unifying and simplifying Mac security & maintenance

## Current Mac Security Landscape

### Existing Tools & Fragmentation
1. **System Information & Diagnostics:**
   - **Tools:** 
     - **EtreCheck:** System report generation
     - **OnyX:** System maintenance & configuration
     - **Pareto Security:** Basic security checks
     - **KnockKnock:** Launch item checker
     - **BlockBlock:** Installation monitor
     - **XProCheck:** Malware definitions
     - **LockRattler:** Security system checks
     - **Silent Knight:** Security update checks
     - **DHS:** Dylib vulnerabilities/hijack search
     - **Signet:** Signature verification
     - **Taccy:** Privacy permission checks
     - **Murus:** Packet firewall management
     - **Apparency:** File integrity
     - **Lynis:** System security audit
     - **Zap (OWASP ZAP):** Vulnerabilities in webapps
     - **Wireshark/TCPdump:** Packet Sniffing
     - **Rkhunter:** Rootkit detector
     - **Little Snitch:** Network connections
     - **VirusTotal:** Check IPs

2. **Problems with Current Approach:**
   - Tools don't communicate with each other
   - Inconsistent interfaces and overlapping functionality
   - Varying levels of maintenance and different learning curves
   - No unified data view
   - CLI power hidden behind complexity
   - Time wasted on learning curve
   - Copying and Pasting between tools

### What CLI Can Actually Do
- Network monitoring (tcpdump, lsof, netstat)
- Process monitoring (ps, top, htop)
- System configuration (defaults, nvram)
- Security settings (spctl, csrutil)
- File system monitoring (fs_usage, opensnoop)
- Hardware diagnostics (system_profiler)
- Application management (codesign, xattr)

## DōmAI Solution

### Core Philosophy
- "One dome to protect it all. One AI to find them. One alliance to bring them and in quarantine, bind them."
- Unified interface for all security/maintenance tasks
- Progressive learning through use
- Power of CLI with accessibility of GUI
- Adaptive to user skill level

## Real Talk Section - Extended

### Why Everything's So Fragmented
1. **Historical reasons:**
   - Tools developed independently
   - Different developers solving specific problems
   - No standardization
   - Apple's changing security model

2. **Technical reasons:**
   - Different subsystems
   - Varying permission requirements
   - Complex integration needs
   - System update challenges

3. **Market reasons:**
   - Niche solutions
   - Different target users
   - Varying business models
   - Support limitations

### How We're Fixing This
1. **Technical Integration:**
   - Unified command framework
   - Consistent permission model
   - Centralized monitoring
   - Standardized data presentation

2. **User Experience:**
   - Single learning curve
   - Progressive feature revelation
   - Consistent interface
   - Contextual help

3. **Security Approach:**
   - Comprehensive protection
   - Intelligent monitoring
   - Proactive maintenance
   - Educational components

## Additional Technical Considerations

### Real-Time Dual-Stream Interface 
DōmAI introduces a revolutionary approach to security analysis through two parallel text streams displayed side by side:

1. **Crisis Stream (Primary Interaction)**
   - Natural language input ("I think I've been hacked")
   - Brief, focused clarifying questions:
     ```
     Is this concern due to:
     a) Slow performance
     b) Unexpected network activity
     c) Strange files or programs
     d) Other (describe)
     ```
   - Users can choose an option, skip questions entirely, or respond in natural language
   - Shows real-time security checks and results
   - Maintains focus on immediate security concerns

2. **Knowledge Stream (Parallel Context)**
   - Updates in real-time alongside the crisis stream
   - Explains why specific tests are being run
   - Provides educational context without interrupting
   - Makes security decisions transparent
   - Builds understanding during actual security events

**How It Works:**
1. **User Input Phase:** Users describe concerns in natural language, LLM asks minimal, skippable clarifying questions, system begins prioritizing security checks.
2. **Analysis Phase:**
   - **Crisis Stream:**
     ```
     Running network packet sniffer...
     Found 3 suspicious packets
     Checking process list...
     ```
   - **Knowledge Stream:**
     ```
     Network scan uses tcpdump to monitor not only
     active connections, but packets as well. Packet
     sniffing is when we monitor...
     ```

3. **Real-Time Response:**
   - **Crisis Stream** focuses on immediate findings, action items, critical alerts, and next steps.
   - **Knowledge Stream** explains why tests were chosen, what results mean, and provides security concepts and technical context.

This dual-stream approach solves a critical problem in security tools: maintaining urgent security response while building user knowledge, without either goal compromising the other.

## Practicability Analysis - A More Precise Approach

### Why Language Precision Matters
When building security tools, the difference between "practical" and "practicable" isn't just semantic - it's the difference between "yeah, we could do that" and "yes, this will actually work in the real world."

### Real-World Implementability Assessment

#### What's Actually Practicable Now
1. **User Interface & Education**
   - Adaptive learning ✓

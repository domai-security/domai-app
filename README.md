# DōmAI Security Alliance - Complete Project Documentation

## Project Overview
- **Name:** DōmAI (Dōmei + Dome + AI)
- **Website:** domai.dev
- **Support:** humans@domai.dev
- **Technical Contact:** ai@domai.dev
- **Purpose:** Unifying and simplifying Mac security & maintenance

## Current Mac Security Landscape

### Existing Tools & Fragmentation

**System Information & Diagnostics:**
- **Tools:** EtreCheck, OnyX, Pareto Security, KnockKnock, BlockBlock, XProCheck, LockRattler, Silent Knight, DHS, Signet, Taccy, Murus, Apparency, Lynis, Zap (OWASP ZAP), Wireshark/TCPdump, Rkhunter, Little Snitch, VirusTotal.
- **Problems:**
  - Lack of communication between tools
  - Inconsistent interfaces and overlapping functionality
  - Different tool maintenance levels and learning complexities
  - No unified data view, resulting in inefficiencies

**What CLI Can Actually Do:**
- Network monitoring (tcpdump, lsof, netstat)
- Process monitoring (ps, top, htop)
- System configuration (defaults, nvram)
- Security settings (spctl, csrutil)
- File system monitoring (fs_usage, opensnoop)
- Hardware diagnostics (system_profiler)
- Application management (codesign, xattr)

## DōmAI Solution

### Core Philosophy
"One dome to protect it all. One AI to find them. One alliance to bring them and in quarantine, bind them."
- Unified interface for security/maintenance tasks
- Progressive learning through use
- Power of CLI with the accessibility of GUI
- Adaptability to user skill level

## Real Talk Section - Extended

### Why Everything's So Fragmented
- **Historical Reasons:** Independent tool development, lack of standardization, evolving Apple security model.
- **Technical Reasons:** Complex integration needs, varying permission requirements, different subsystems.
- **Market Reasons:** Niche solutions, diverse user targets, differing business models, support limitations.

### How We're Fixing This
- **Technical Integration:** Unified command framework, consistent permissions, centralized monitoring, standardized data.
- **User Experience:** Simplified learning curve, progressive feature exposure, consistent interface, contextual help.
- **Security Approach:** Comprehensive protection, intelligent monitoring, proactive maintenance, educational components.

## Additional Technical Considerations

### Real-Time Dual-Stream Interface:
DōmAI presents a unique security analysis with two side-by-side text streams:
1. **Crisis Stream (Primary Interaction)**
   - Handles natural language input regarding immediate security concerns.
   - Provides focused inquiries and real-time security checks.
   - Centers on critical alerts and action items.

2. **Knowledge Stream (Parallel Context)**
   - Educates users on test rationales without disrupting urgent tasks.
   - Builds user understanding and transparency in security processes.

**How It Works:**
- **User Input Phase:** Users input concerns in natural language; priority checks are initiated.
- **Analysis Phase:** The Crisis Stream shows findings, while the Knowledge Stream explains test selections and results.
- **Real-Time Response:** Offers alerts and educational insights in tandem, ensuring user awareness without affecting urgency.

### CLI Integration:
- Provides a wrapper for complex commands and visual command building, encouraging a command learning environment.

### Permission Management:
- Streamlines permission requests, providing clear explanations, tracking, and awareness of security impacts.

### System Integration:
- Manages kernel and system extensions, network filters, and file monitoring services effectively.

## Practicability Analysis - A More Precise Approach

### Real-World Implementability Assessment:
- **What's Immediately Practicable:** User education, basic monitoring, simple CLI wrapping, achievement system.
- **Practicable With Work:** Advanced monitoring, basic packet analysis, security state management.
- **Needs Innovation:** Deep integration, full system access, enterprise features.

### The "Actually Doable" Roadmap:
- **Phase 1:** Foundation tasks like basic monitoring and CLI wrapping (3-4 months).
- **Phase 2:** Enhanced features like advanced monitoring and packet analysis (4-6 months post-Phase 1).
- **Phase 3:** Innovative solutions like deep system integration and AI features (6-12 months post-Phase 2).

## Missing Features Analysis

### Key Areas Lacking Integration:
- **Network Analysis & Threat Intel:** Lack of integrated threat scoring, real-time visualization, and automated response.
- **System Security:** Need for unified permission management and security state management.
- **User Experience & Integration:** Require educational integration, intuitive interfaces, and tool communication enhancements.
- **Enterprise Features:** Needing fleet management, compliance features, and team collaboration capabilities.

## Elevator Pitch

"Imagine if all your Mac security tools worked together seamlessly, educating you as they protected, and growing with your expertise. That's DōmAI. We've unified fragmented security tools into one intelligent system that adapts to your skill level—from beginner to expert. DōmAI is not just another security tool—it's your security alliance."

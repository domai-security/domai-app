# DōmAI Security Alliance - Complete Project Documentation

## Project Overview
- Name: DōmAI (Dōmei + Dome + AI)
- Website: domai.dev
- Support: humans@domai.dev
- Technical: ai@domai.dev
- Purpose: Unifying and simplifying Mac security & maintenance

## Core Innovations

### 1. Dual-Stream Security Analysis
DōmAI introduces a groundbreaking approach to security monitoring and education:

#### Crisis Stream
- Real-time security analysis focused on immediate threats
- Direct, action-oriented responses
- Prioritizes critical information during active issues
- No interruption for educational content during crises

#### Knowledge Stream
- Parallel educational context without interrupting crisis handling
- Real-time explanation of security concepts
- Progressive technical depth based on user expertise
- Learning opportunities identified from actual security events

### 2. Intelligent Security Interaction
- Natural language query processing
- Proactive security plan presentation
- 5-second review window for user control
- Technical command details available via hover tooltips
- Progressive learning through real security events

## Current Mac Security Landscape

### Existing Tools & Fragmentation
1. System Information & Diagnostics
   - EtreCheck: System report generation
   - OnyX: System maintenance & configuration
   - Pareto Security: Basic security checks
   - KnockKnock: Launch item checker
   - BlockBlock: Installation monitor
   - XProCheck: Malware definitions
   - LockRattler: Security system checks
   - Silent Knight: Security update checks
   - DHS: Dylib vulnerabilities/hijack search
   - Signet: Signature verification
   - Taccy: Privacy permission checks
   - Murus: Packet firewall management
   - Apparency: File integrity
   - Lynis: System security audit
   - Zap (OWASP ZAP): vulnerabilities in webapps
   - Wireshark/TCPdump: Packet Sniffing
   - Rkhunter: Rootkit detector
   - Little Snitch: Network connections
   - Virustotal: Check IPs

2. Problems with Current Approach
   - Tools don't communicate with each other
   - Inconsistent interfaces
   - Overlapping functionality
   - Varying levels of maintenance
   - Different learning curves
   - No unified data view
   - CLI power hidden behind complexity
   - Time wasted on learning curve
   - Copying and Pasting between tools

### What CLI Can Actually Do
- Network monitoring (tcpdump, lsof, netstat)
- Process monitoring (ps, top, htop)
- System configuration (defaults, nvram)
- Security settings (spctl, csrutil)
- File system monitoring (fs_usage, opensnoop)
- Hardware diagnostics (system_profiler)
- Application management (codesign, xattr)

## DōmAI Solution

### Core Philosophy
- "One dome to protect it all. One AI to find them. One alliance to bring them and in quarantine, bind them."
- Unified interface for all security/maintenance tasks
- Progressive learning through use
- Power of CLI with accessibility of GUI
- Adaptive to user skill level

## Real Talk Section - Extended

### Why Everything's So Fragmented
1. Historical reasons:
   - Tools developed independently
   - Different developers solving specific problems
   - No standardization
   - Apple's changing security model

2. Technical reasons:
